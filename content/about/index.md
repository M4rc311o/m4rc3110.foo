I am a student of Brno University of Technology where I study Information Security. In the past, I was programming embedded systems in C. Where I discovered my passion for finding out how computers, networks, and other systems work at a low level.

Since then, I have been working on improving my skills and knowledge in the areas of operating system security, network security, reverse engineering, and programming in low-level(C, Assembly) and high-level(Python, Java) programming languages.

In the future, I plan to obtain certifications such as OSCP or CRTP and most importantly to keep learning and gaining new experiences in the field of cybersecurity.
